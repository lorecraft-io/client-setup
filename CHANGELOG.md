# Changelog

All notable changes to `cli-maxxing` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- README: social-links badge strip (X · LinkedIn · YouTube · Instagram, ruvnet-style for-the-badge) inserted into the centered header block beneath the banner.
- **`cbrain` + `cbraintg` shell shortcuts** (step 10.9) — quick-launch aliases for the Brain² + Telegram-bridged sessions.
- Step 5 — full upstream URL verification across all five external MCPs (morgen / motion / playwright / granola / n8n).
- Step 7 — GitHub MCP migrated to the hosted endpoint at `github/github-mcp-server` (the deprecated `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` is removed).
- Step 5 — Notion MCP migrated to the hosted OAuth endpoint at `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`. No integration token, no per-page sharing — Notion handles auth on first use via browser OAuth.
- Step 5 — Google Calendar MCP swapped to `@cocal/google-calendar-mcp` (actively maintained); the bare `google-calendar-mcp` package was a year-stale fork.

### Changed
- Git history rewrite: `git filter-repo` collapsed all author/committer identities (dependabot[bot], lorecraft-io, nate variants) into a single `Nate Davidovich <nate@lorecraft.io>` identity across `main` and both release tags (v1.9.1, v2.0.0). All `Co-authored-by:` trailers stripped (162 of them — mostly `claude-flow <ruv@ruv.net>` carryover from pre-rebrand). Tag commit hashes changed; this repo has no published npm artifact, so no downstream impact.
- Step 6 ordering — `gh` CLI moved from Step 3 to Step 7 so the full GitHub stack (CLI + MCP + workflows) ships together.
- Step 5 — design-stack MCPs (Figma / Excalidraw / Gamma / Magic / YouTube / IG) removed from cli-maxxing cheatsheets — these now live exclusively in the `creativity-maxxing` install. cli-maxxing remains the lean core terminal install.
- Step 5 — `2ndbrain-maxxing` references flipped to `2ndBrain-mogging` across `README-SECTIONS/` and `tests/`.

### Fixed
- Step 2 (`step-2/ghostty-install.sh`): post-install summary now includes a yellow "ONE MORE STEP — GRANT FULL DISK ACCESS" section with click-by-click instructions (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → toggle Ghostty ON, with the `+` → `/Applications` fallback if Ghostty isn't listed). New `--open-fda` flag jumps directly to the right pane via the canonical `x-apple.systempreferences:...?Privacy_AllFiles` URL. Closes item 1 of the WAGMI Apr-22 install-call bug catalog (`project_wagmi_install_bugs_2026_04_22.md`) — every WAGMI teammate hit silent FDA-permission errors on first launch.
- Step 1-5 — anchored MCP grep patterns at `^<name>:` so substring matches don't trigger false-positive "already installed" detection.
- Step 5 — BSD grep compat fix in Motion detection (macOS `grep` doesn't support `-P` like GNU does; pattern simplified accordingly).
- Step 6 — `SAVED_TOKEN` env var unset after self-test validation so a stale value doesn't leak into the next step.
- Step 7 / Step 8 / step-final — atomic MCP match patterns tightened to prevent partial overlaps.
- `uninstall.sh` + `INSTALL.md` — `cbraintg` ownership note + stale references cleaned up.
- Sub-modules: `gitfix-skill` and `rmini-skill` picked up the residual stash improvements from the step-forward rebase.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed — Major split + rebrand

This is the first version after the post-mogging split (per `project_cli_maxxing_split`). The original "AI Super Setup" stack was carved into three focused repos:

- **cli-maxxing** (this repo) — core terminal install: shell, package managers, Claude Code, MCPs (calendar/task/automation), GitHub stack, safetycheck.
- **creativity-maxxing** — design / video / audio / transcription tooling.
- **2ndBrain-mogging** — Obsidian + Claude Code second brain + skills + scheduled agents.

### Added — Step structure
- 8 numbered steps + 1 final step, with one command per step. See `README-SECTIONS/step-ordering.md`.
- `gitfix-skill` and `rmini-skill` as in-tree submodules.
- `terminal-academy` submodule — gamified terminal trainer.
- `templates/` — reusable install-step scaffolds.

## [1.9.1] - pre-rebrand

Last release under the "AI Super Setup" branding. Preserved as a tag for lineage.
