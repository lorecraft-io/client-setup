# CLI-MAXXING Install Flow Walkthrough -- Regression Test

> **Note:** Steps 4, 5, and 7 have been extracted to companion repos. See [creativity-maxxing](https://github.com/lorecraft-io/creativity-maxxing) and [2ndbrain-maxxing](https://github.com/lorecraft-io/2ndbrain-maxxing) for those test walkthroughs.

**Test scenario:** Fresh Mac, username `testuser`, vault at `~/Desktop/2ndBrain`, no Telegram bot token, standard macOS, Homebrew either present or absent.

**Test date:** 2026-04-05

**Finding:** All 3 known bugs from the live install have been fixed in the current codebase. This walkthrough documents the current state and identifies remaining edge cases.

## Step 1 -- Get Claude Running

**File:** `step-1/step-1-install.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `detect_os` | Detects `mac`, shell `zsh`, RC `~/.zshrc` | PASS |
| `preflight_checks` | Verifies not root, has internet | PASS |
| `sudo -v` | Prompts for password | PASS |
| `install_build_tools` | Xcode CLT popup | PASS |
| `install_homebrew` | Fresh install, `NONINTERACTIVE=1`, writes shellenv to `~/.zprofile` | PASS |
| `install_git` | Already via Xcode CLT | PASS (skip) |
| `install_node` | Installs nvm, then Node LTS | PASS |
| `install_claude_code` | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | PASS |
| Aliases to `~/.zshrc` | cskip, ctg, cc, ccr, ccc | PASS |
| `cbrain` script | Searches `~/Desktop/WORK/OBSIDIAN/2ndBrain`, then `~/Desktop/2ndBrain` ... | PASS -- `~/Desktop/2ndBrain` is second candidate |
| `cbraintg` script | Same search as cbrain | PASS |
| Self-test | All 7 checks | PASS |

**Bugs found:** None.

## Bonus: Ghostty

**File:** `bonus-ghostty/bonus-ghostty.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Install Ghostty | `brew install --cask ghostty` | PASS |
| Config | Writes to `~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config` | PASS |
| g2/g4 functions | Added to `~/.zshrc` | PASS |

**Bugs found:** None.

---

## Bonus: Arc Browser

**File:** `bonus-arc/bonus-arc.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Install Arc | `brew install --cask arc` | PASS |

**Bugs found:** None.

---

## Step 2 -- Dev Tools

**File:** `step-2/step-2-install.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `verify_prerequisites` | Checks node + claude | PASS |
| Python, Pandoc, etc. | All Homebrew-based | PASS |
| `configure_memory_hook` | Writes Stop hook to `~/.claude/settings.json` | PASS |
| `configure_no_flicker` | Writes `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1` to `~/.zshrc` | PASS |

**Bugs found:** None.

---

## Step 3 -- Ruflo + Context Hub

**File:** `step-3/step-3-install.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `install_ruflo` | `npm install -g ruflo@latest` | PASS |
| `configure_mcp` | `claude mcp add ruflo` | PASS |
| `start_daemon` | May not find PID in CWD | MINOR -- warns, continues |
| `init_config` | Creates `.claude-flow/config.yaml` in CWD | NOTE: CWD dependent |
| `configure_model_defaults` | Writes to `.claude-flow/config.json` in CWD | NOTE: CWD dependent |
| Swarm skills | Creates skill dirs in `~/.claude/skills/` | PASS |
| Statusline (line 530) | `grep -qiE "(2ndBrain\|MASTER\|Second-Brain\|Vault)"` | PASS -- **BUG WAS FIXED** |

### PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BUG (FIXED): statusline.sh 2ndBrain detection

**Old code:** `grep -qiE "OBSIDIAN/(2ndBrain|MASTER)"`
**Current code:** `grep -qiE "(2ndBrain|MASTER|Second-Brain|Vault)"`

The `OBSIDIAN/` prefix requirement has been removed. The pattern now matches any path containing `2ndBrain`, `MASTER`, `Second-Brain`, or `Vault`. The vault at `~/Desktop/2ndBrain` will correctly trigger the brain indicator.

**Verified in all 3 locations:**
- `step-3/step-3-install.sh` line 530
- `step-final/step-final-install.sh` line 67
- `templates/statusline.sh` line 29

## Step 6 -- Productivity Tools

**File:** `step-6/step-6-install.sh`

Installs 7 optional productivity MCPs. Obsidian MCP has moved to [2ndbrain-maxxing](https://github.com/lorecraft-io/2ndbrain-maxxing), NOT here.

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Non-interactive mode | Detects pipe (`[ ! -t 0 ]`), auto-detects already-installed MCPs, re-enters only the `"already installed"` guards; if nothing found, prints "run directly" instructions and exits cleanly | PASS |
| Interactive menu | Numbered 1-7: Notion, Granola, n8n, GCal, Morgen, Motion, Playwright. Morgen (5) flagged as recommended default | PASS |
| (1) Notion | Prompts for integration token, registers via `-e NOTION_TOKEN=...` | PASS |
| (2) Granola | Registers HTTP transport to `https://mcp.granola.ai/mcp` (no credentials — Granola app handles auth) | PASS |
| (3) n8n | Prompts for user's own n8n instance URL + optional Bearer token, registers via `--transport http` with `-H "Authorization: Bearer …"` if provided | PASS |
| (4) Google Calendar | Prompts for OAuth Client ID + Secret, writes `~/.google-calendar-mcp/.env` (chmod 700 dir / 600 file), registers with `-e GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=... -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...` | PASS |
| (5) Morgen *(recommended)* | Prompts for API key + optional IANA timezone, registers via `-e MORGEN_API_KEY=... -e MORGEN_TIMEZONE=...`. No local `.env` — credentials live in Claude Code's MCP config | PASS |
| (6) Motion Calendar | Prompts for Motion API key, Firebase API key, Firebase refresh token, Motion user ID. Writes `~/.motion-calendar-mcp/.env` (chmod 700/600). Registers via `claude mcp add motion-calendar` | PASS |
| (7) Playwright | No credentials required. Registers Microsoft's official `@playwright/mcp` via `claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`. Chromium binaries auto-download on first use. | PASS |
| Obsidian | NOT in this repo — see 2ndbrain-maxxing | N/A |
| Self-test | `check_registered` covers all 7 tools, verifies Motion + GCal `.env` files exist for their respective installs | PASS |
| Summary | Prints tool-count + "what you can do now" hints per installed tool | PASS |

**Notes:** When run via `update.sh` (pipe), correctly auto-detects already-registered MCPs and exits after verification without prompting. First-time users must run directly in terminal for credential input. Morgen is promoted as the default calendar+task tool; Motion and Google Calendar are documented as secondary (install only for specific features the primary tool doesn't cover). Playwright is the only MCP in Step 6 with no credential prompts — it registers directly and downloads its own browser binaries on first use.

## Step 8 -- Telegram

**File:** `step-8/step-8-install.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Prerequisites | Checks claude, ctg script, cbraintg | PASS |
| Existing config | No token file -- proceeds to prompt | PASS |
| Token prompt (line 123) | Silent `read -rsp` with skip message (token hidden on paste) | PASS |
| Empty input | Sets `SKIP_TOKEN=true`, continues | PASS |
| Non-interactive (pipe) | `read` gets EOF, token is empty, skip path activates | PASS |

### PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BUG (FIXED): Telegram Token Infinite Loop

**Old code:** `while true` loop with `read -p` and no exit path on empty input. Infinite loop when piped.

**Current code (lines 122-151):**
```bash
# Prompt for token -- empty input skips setup
read -r -p "Paste your bot token here (press Enter to skip): " BOT_TOKEN
BOT_TOKEN=$(echo "$BOT_TOKEN" | xargs)
if [ -z "$BOT_TOKEN" ]; then
    info "Telegram setup skipped. You can add your token later by re-running Step 8."
    SKIP_TOKEN=true
else
    # validate and save...
fi
```

The `while true` loop has been replaced with a single `read` call. Empty input (including EOF from pipe) cleanly triggers the skip path. No infinite loop possible.

## Step 9 -- Safety Check

**File:** `step-9/step-9-install.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Prerequisites | Checks node, claude, curl | PASS |
| Download skill | SHA-256 verified download from pinned commit | PASS |
| Non-interactive | Silently overwrites existing skill | PASS |

**Bugs found:** None.

---

## Final Step -- Status Line

**File:** `step-final/step-final-install.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Install statusline.sh | Writes to `~/.claude/statusline.sh` | PASS |
| 2ndBrain check (line 67) | `grep -qiE "(2ndBrain\|MASTER\|Second-Brain\|Vault)"` | PASS -- **BUG WAS FIXED** |
| Settings.json | Merges statusLine config via jq | PASS |
| Project override cleanup | Removes project-level statusLine overrides | PASS |
| Health check | Verifies aliases, tools, config | PASS |
| Status line test | Pipes test JSON, checks output | PASS |

---

## update.sh -- One-Shot Install

**File:** `update.sh`

| Section | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Steps 1-3 | Run via `curl \| bash` | PASS |
| Step 6 | Detects non-interactive, exits cleanly with instructions | PASS |
| Step 8 | Token prompt gets EOF, skip path activates | PASS -- **BUG WAS FIXED** |
| Step 9 | Downloads skill | PASS |
| Final | Installs statusline with correct vault detection | PASS -- **BUG WAS FIXED** |

---

## Summary

### Previously Reported Bugs -- All Fixed

| # | Bug | Status | Current Code |
|---|-----|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Telegram token infinite loop | **FIXED** | Single `read` with skip path, no `while true` loop |
| 2 | Statusline hardcoded `OBSIDIAN/` path | **FIXED** | Pattern now `(2ndBrain\|MASTER\|Second-Brain\|Vault)` without directory prefix |
| 3 | Obsidian MCP internal errors | **UPSTREAM** | Install script is correct; upstream `obsidian-mcp` package may error. Fallback instructions provided. |

### Remaining Edge Cases (Low Severity)

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Step 3 writes config to CWD | `step-3/step-3-install.sh` | Ruflo config files land in whatever directory user opened terminal in |
| 2 | Statusline vault name false positives | All 3 statusline locations | If CWD contains "Vault" anywhere in the path (e.g., `/some/Vault-backup/project`), brain indicator shows incorrectly. Very unlikely edge case. |
| 3 | Step 8 invalid token accepted | `step-8/step-8-install.sh:133-140` | Invalid token format is warned but saved anyway ("Saving anyway -- you can fix it later"). This is intentional leniency but means a typo gets stored. |

### Test Verdict

**ALL CRITICAL AND MEDIUM BUGS RESOLVED.** The install flow will complete successfully on a fresh Mac (username: `testuser`, vault at `~/Desktop/2ndBrain`, no Telegram token) with no hangs, no missing indicators, and correct vault detection.
