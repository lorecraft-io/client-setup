# README Updates -- Post-Allan-Install Review

This document specifies the changes recommended for README.md based on the live install test on Allan's machine (username: `alvov`, vault at `~/Desktop/2ndBrain`).

**Key finding:** All 3 reported bugs from the live install have already been fixed in the current codebase. The README updates below are documentation improvements to prevent confusion for future users.

## Change 1: Mark Step 8 (Telegram) as Optional (More Prominent)

Step 8 is already described as optional in the body text, but the Quick Nav table and Installation Order table don't call it out. Since this is a step that requires creating an external bot and is completely unneeded for the core workflow, it should be labeled clearly.

### In the Quick Nav table (around line 22)

**Current:**
```
| [Step 8](#step-8---telegram) | Telegram | Message Claude from your phone via Telegram bot | ~2 min |
```

**Recommended:**
```
| [Step 8](#step-8---telegram) | Telegram *(optional)* | Message Claude from your phone via Telegram bot | ~2 min |
```

### In the Installation Order table (around line 1193)

**Current:**
```
| 8 | Telegram | Telegram bot setup -- message Claude from your phone |
```

**Recommended:**
```
| 8 | Telegram *(optional)* | Telegram bot setup -- message Claude from your phone. Skip if you don't use Telegram. |
```

## Change 2: Document Vault Path + Naming Convention

The vault detection logic searches a fixed list of candidate paths. Users who name their vault something unexpected or put it in a non-standard location will get a default path or an error. This should be documented.

### In Step 7a, after "Name it something..." (around line 853)

**Current:**
```
3. Name it something you'll remember. "2ndBrain" or "Second-Brain" or "Vault" all work fine.
4. For the location, pick somewhere easy to find. We recommend your **Desktop** or a **Documents** folder. Don't bury it deep in some random directory.
```

**Recommended:**
```
3. Name it something you'll remember. We recommend **"2ndBrain"** -- the scripts and status line look for this name by default. "Second-Brain" or "Vault" also work.
4. For the location, pick **your Desktop**. The scripts search these locations in order:
   - `~/Desktop/WORK/OBSIDIAN/2ndBrain`
   - `~/Desktop/2ndBrain` **(recommended for most people)**
   - `~/Desktop/Second-Brain`
   - `~/Desktop/Vault`
   - `~/Documents/2ndBrain`
   - `~/Documents/Second-Brain`

   If your vault is somewhere else, set the `VAULT_PATH` environment variable before running Step 7:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_PATH=~/path/to/your/vault
   ```
```

---

## Change 3: Status Line Vault Detection Note

### In the Final Step section, after the indicator table (around line 1107)

**Add this paragraph:**
```
The status line detects your vault by checking if your current working directory contains "2ndBrain", "Second-Brain", "Vault", or "MASTER" in the path. If you named your vault something else entirely, the brain indicator won't appear -- but everything still works normally. The detection is automatic and requires no configuration.
```

## Change 4: Add Troubleshooting Section

### Add before "You're Ready" (before line 1147)

```markdown

## Troubleshooting

[Back to top](#quick-nav)

### Telegram: pressing Enter skips setup

This is intentional. If you press Enter without pasting a token, the script skips Telegram setup and continues. You can always re-run Step 8 later when you have your bot token ready.

### Step 6 (Productivity Tools) skips when run through the update command

Step 6 requires interactive input for API credentials. When run via `curl | bash` (including through the update command), it detects non-interactive mode and exits with instructions.

**Fix:** Run Step 6 directly in your terminal:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorecraft-io/cli-maxxing/main/step-6/step-6-install.sh)
```

### Obsidian MCP returns internal errors

After Step 7d installs the Obsidian MCP server, you might see "internal error" messages when Claude tries to use it. This is usually a temporary issue with the upstream `obsidian-mcp` package.

**Fix:** Try these in order:
1. Close and reopen your Claude session (`Ctrl+C`, then `cskip` or `cbrain`)
2. Re-add the MCP server manually:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --scope user obsidian -- npx -y obsidian-mcp ~/Desktop/2ndBrain
   ```
   (Replace with your actual vault path)
3. If it still errors, Claude can read and write files in your vault directly -- the Obsidian MCP is a convenience layer, not a hard requirement

### `cbrain` says it can't find my vault

The `cbrain` command searches a fixed list of common locations. If your vault isn't in one of these spots, set the `VAULT_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
VAULT_PATH=~/path/to/your/vault cbrain
```

Or add it permanently to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export VAULT_PATH="$HOME/path/to/your/vault"
```

### Status line doesn't show the brain emoji

The brain indicator appears when your working directory contains "2ndBrain", "Second-Brain", "Vault", or "MASTER" in the path. If you named your vault something different, edit `~/.claude/statusline.sh` and update the detection pattern to include your vault name.

### General: a step failed or something is missing

Run the update command to re-run everything. It skips what's already installed and fills in any gaps:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorecraft-io/cli-maxxing/main/update.sh | bash
```

Or open a `cskip` session and describe the problem to Claude. It can diagnose and fix most issues on the spot.
```

## Change 5: Note about Granola MCP

The bug report mentioned "Granola MCP returned internal errors." Granola is NOT installed by any step in CLI-MAXXING. If this was present on Allan's machine, it was installed separately. No README change needed, but worth noting that this is not a CLI-MAXXING issue.
