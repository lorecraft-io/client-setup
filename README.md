## Before You Start

[Back to top](#quick-nav)

- Your computer needs to be from roughly **2020 or later** (macOS Big Sur+, Windows 10+, or a recent Linux).
- You need an **internet connection** since the scripts download everything live.
- **Don't run it as admin/root.** Just open your terminal normally and paste the command.
- If anything is already installed on your machine, the scripts will detect that and skip it automatically.

---

## How It Works

There are three steps. Run them in order. Each one builds on the last.

**Step 1** is the only part that feels "techy." This step gets the bare essentials on your machine so Claude (your AI assistant) and Warp (your new terminal) can run. You paste one command and it handles the rest, but there are a few manual steps after it finishes, like setting up your Warp account and logging into Claude. This is the most hands-on part of the entire process. After Step 1, you can ask Claude questions at any point. If something doesn't make sense, just ask. That's the whole point.

**Step 2** is where you install the rest of your development tools. Things like file converters, search tools, and utilities. You run this from inside Warp after Step 1 is done. Much more straightforward.

**Step 3** *(coming soon)* is where you set up ClaudeFlow, the multi-agent orchestration layer that makes Claude way more powerful.

### Already have Claude Code installed?

If you already have Claude Code working on your machine, you can skip Step 1 entirely. Just make sure you have [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) installed (we use it for the Shift+Tab permissions toggle), then jump straight to [Step 2](#step-2---dev-tools). Everything will work the same. You can paste the install commands directly in Warp, or if you prefer, download this repo as a ZIP from GitHub, unzip it, and tell Claude to run the scripts from whatever folder they landed in.

### Bonus

## Step 1 - Get Claude Running

[Back to top](#quick-nav)

This step is the foundation. It installs the minimum needed to get Claude Code working on your machine.

**Heads up:** This is the most manual part of the setup. The script itself runs automatically, but afterwards you'll need to set up Warp and your Claude account yourself. Don't worry, it's all spelled out below. Once you're past this, Claude is there to help you with everything else.

### macOS / Linux

Open Terminal and paste this command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorecraft-io/ai-super-user-setup/main/step-1/step-1-install.sh | bash
```

### Windows

Open PowerShell and paste this command:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorecraft-io/ai-super-user-setup/main/step-1/step-1-install.ps1 | iex
```

### What This Step Installs

These are the tools that get installed automatically when you run the command above:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| Homebrew (Mac) / winget (Win) | This is a package manager. It installs other software for you. |
| Git | This tracks and manages code changes. |
| Node.js (v18+) | This runs JavaScript. Claude Code needs it to work. |
| Warp Terminal | This is your new terminal. More on this below. |
| Claude Code | This is your AI coding assistant. The main tool you'll be using. |

### Why Warp Terminal?

This step installs [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) as your terminal. Here's why we use it:

- **Shift+Tab to toggle permissions.** When Claude is running, you can press Shift+Tab to switch between normal mode (where Claude asks before doing anything) and auto-approve mode (where Claude just does it). No need to exit and relaunch.
- **Built for AI workflows.** Warp handles long-running output, code blocks, and multi-step processes better than a standard terminal.
- **Works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.** Same experience everywhere.

After the script finishes, press **Ctrl+C** if anything is still running, close your old terminal, and open Warp. Everything from here on happens in Warp.

### After the Script Finishes

#### 1a. Open Warp

Open **Warp** (it was just installed by the script above).

Warp will ask you to create an account. Go ahead and sign up. **The free plan is all you need.** No payment required for Warp.

#### 1b. Configure Warp

Before doing anything else, you need to change one setting:

1. Open Warp settings (**Cmd+Comma** on Mac, **Ctrl+Comma** on Windows/Linux)
2. Go to **Features**
3. The very first setting is **Default Mode**. Make sure it's set to **Terminal**, not Agent

This keeps Warp acting as a normal terminal so Claude Code runs properly.

> **If you see "Agent Oz" instead of a terminal:** Press the **Esc** key. This switches you back to the normal terminal view. That's why we changed the default to Terminal, so this doesn't keep happening.

#### 1c. Set Up Your Claude Account

You'll need a Claude account with an active subscription before you can use Claude Code. **Do this now if you haven't already.** You won't be able to log in during Step 2 without it.

Sign up at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai).

#### Why Claude?

We use Claude because it's genuinely the best AI platform for the kind of work we do. Not marketing, just what we've seen firsthand. Claude consistently outperforms other models at understanding complex instructions, writing clean code, and reasoning through multi-step problems without losing the thread. They also ship new features incredibly fast. The pace of improvement is unreal.

But beyond the tech, we chose Anthropic for how they operate. Their CEO Dario Amodei left OpenAI specifically to take a more responsible approach to AI development. He's shown real backbone, including being willing to walk away from government contracts rather than compromise on their principles. Anthropic leads on safety research, they're transparent about what their models can and can't do, and they actually listen to their users when building new features. No shady practices, no cutting corners, no chasing hype at the expense of doing things right.

That philosophy shows up in how Claude actually works. It's careful, honest, and doesn't try to BS you when it doesn't know something.

Claude is the smartest tool in the room, built by people who actually care about getting this right.

#### Subscription Plans

Claude Code requires a paid plan. The software itself is free to install, but to actually use it you'll need one of these:

| Plan | Cost | What you get |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Claude Pro** | $20/month | Good for getting started. Handles everyday tasks like writing code, editing files, and answering questions. You'll hit usage limits if you run long sessions or do heavy back-to-back work. |
| **Claude Max 5x** | $100/month | This gives you 5x the usage of Pro. Best for people who use Claude throughout the day or run multi-step workflows. You can work for hours without hitting a wall. |
| **Claude Max 20x** | $200/month | This gives you 20x the usage of Pro. For power users running complex, long-running tasks like full codebase refactors, multi-agent swarms, or all-day sessions. Virtually unlimited for most people. |

**Our recommendation:** Start with **Pro** ($20/month). If you find yourself getting rate-limited or waiting for usage to reset, upgrade to Max. You'll know pretty quickly which tier fits your workflow.

That's it for Step 1. Before moving on, check out the cheat sheet below. Then continue to Step 2.

## [Keyboard + Command Cheat Sheet](CHEATSHEET.md)

[Back to top](#quick-nav)

This is a quick reference for terminal hotkeys, typing basics, launching Claude, and useful commands. **Read this before starting Step 2**, especially if you're new to working in a terminal.

---

## Step 2 - Dev Tools

[Back to top](#quick-nav)

This step installs the development tools that Claude uses when working on your projects. Things like file converters, search tools, and other utilities that make Claude more capable.

#### 2a. Open Warp

If you haven't already, close your old terminal (press **Ctrl+C** if something is still running, then close the window) and open **Warp**.

> If you see "Agent Oz" instead of a terminal, press **Esc**.

#### 2b. Launch Claude

In Warp, type this command:

```bash
cskip
```

If this is your first time, Claude will automatically open a browser and ask you to log in. Sign in with your Anthropic account.

Once you're in a Claude session, you can ask it questions, and it will help you through the rest of the process. This is where it stops being manual and starts being a conversation.

#### Why auto-approve mode?

When Claude runs in normal mode, it asks your permission before every single action. Every file it reads, every command it runs. During a setup that installs 10+ tools, that means dozens of approval prompts. There's no sound or notification when Claude is waiting for you, so if you look away for a moment, the whole process just sits there frozen until you come back and type "y".

**Auto-approve mode (`cskip`) lets Claude run without stopping to ask.** It will install everything in one smooth pass. You can watch it work in real time, you just don't have to babysit it.

You can always switch back to normal mode later for regular work. This is just for setup.

#### 2c. Run the install

Once you're inside the Claude session, paste this and hit Enter:

**macOS / Linux:**
```
run this command to install my dev tools: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorecraft-io/ai-super-user-setup/main/step-2/step-2-install.sh | bash
```

**Windows:**
```
run this command to install my dev tools: irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorecraft-io/ai-super-user-setup/main/step-2/step-2-install.ps1 | iex
```

Claude will run the install for you. You can watch it work. If Claude tells you to restart your terminal at any point, just close the window, reopen Warp, type `cskip` again, and let Claude know where you left off. It'll pick right back up.

### What This Step Installs

These are the tools that Claude will install for you:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| Python 3 + pip | This runs Python scripts and tools. |
| Pandoc | This converts documents like Word and PowerPoint files into text. |
| xlsx2csv | This converts spreadsheets into a readable format. |
| pdftotext | This extracts text from PDF files. |
| jq | This reads and edits config files. |
| ripgrep | This searches through code fast. Claude Code uses it internally. |
| GitHub CLI | This lets you manage GitHub from your terminal. |
| tree | This shows your folder structure visually. |
| fzf | This helps you find files and commands quickly. |
| wget | This downloads files from the web. |

## Step 3 - ClaudeFlow *(coming soon)*

[Back to top](#quick-nav)

This step installs and configures ClaudeFlow, the multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI agents to work on complex tasks together. You'll need to complete Steps 1 and 2 before running this one.
